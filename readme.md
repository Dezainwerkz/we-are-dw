We are DW
==============
Founded in 2002 and HeadQuarters in Singapore, we design and build digital apps that enhance the userâ€™s experience when interacting on their smartphones and tablets. We are obsessed with creating apps that are actually immediately useful rather than those that get instantly deleted. 12 years later with offices in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, we've had the honor of working with organisations such as IE Singapore, M1, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Jiransoft, Resorts World Genting, Robinsons, and Frasers Centrepoint Malls.

Obsessed with details
==============
How do we design products that get used and not deleted? We design the way we like to use them ourselves. From concept to execution to the smallest details, we discuss, iterate, program, test them again and again so that when its finally in your hands, it would be something not only you will use, but excitedly share with friends, colleagues and family.

Our passion
==============
Our team has a shared passion for interaction design, information architecture, design research, content strategy and usability. We believe in iterative, tactical prototyping, and that quickly trying solutions is the best way to validate an idea.

What we do
==============
##### Create a brand new application or product concept.
Perhaps you have an innovative idea that is unique and one-of-a-kind. Your idea has little or no existing legacy, but you want to design the best possible product quickly and affordably. 

##### Improve an existing application or product concept. 
Perhaps you already have a mobile site that is losing customer traffic or needs a new, fresh look. Redesigning existing apps and sites to take them to the next level is an area in which we excel.
